TODO:

Canvas onLeftClick highlights a region and commands
all units in that area.  Add a goto point function

Canvas onRightClick makes a menu similar to paragon,
highlights the button its over and gives you the
option to create units

Add mini map, maybe make it a popup menu when you
hold down q

When you move multiple units to one spot put them randomly in a circle
with a certain radius around the point clicked


IMPORTANT

Give userID when user logs in and make units bind to a user ID
onRight Click creates a unit


EX:

             point ~~~>     *

                           ___
                         /     \
    finishing area ~~~>  |  *  |
                         \_____/
