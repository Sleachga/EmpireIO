When you move multiple units to one spot put them randomly in a circle
with a certain radius around the point clicked


IMPORTANT

Give userID when user logs in and make units bind to a user ID
onRight Click creates a unit


EX:

             point ~~~>     *

                           ___
                         /     \
    finishing area ~~~>  |  *  |
                         \_____/

INSTEAD -> Put a number next to the type of unit to show how many are there.  If multiple types of units put next to each other or something.
