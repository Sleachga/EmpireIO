### Multiplayer Age-of-Empires NodeJS game


Player will log onto a server with a few other players and start with a few basic units to command.  Units passively mine the resources of the tile they are on (i.e. wood, gold, stone etc...).

* Regular units can be made with food
* Military units can be made with food + gold and will damage/kill to enemy units in the same tile
* Worker units can be made with food + wood and can mine more efficiently than regular units

Game is in-progress but map system and unit creation is working.
I'm Currently working on pop-up menu to create units and mini-map.
